# Bandwagn

Hear music by artists near your geographic location. Explore other cities and see where you've been!

See it in action at [bandwagn.herokuapp.com](http://bandwagn.herokuapp.com/). (A Spotify account is required to use the site.)

Bandwagn was my final project for Comp 20, Web Programming, in fall 2015 at Tufts University.

**Features**
* Geolocation: The application detects the user's location and finds a song by an artist based nearby.
* Front-end framework: The site runs on Bootstrap.
* Charts: The site shows a map of the cities the user has "visited," powered by Google charts.
* Client-side data persistence with local storage: The site stores where the user has been (via local storage) and uses it to display points on the map.
* Server-side data persistence: The site is backed by a database of locations, which serves the client random latitudes and longitudes when they explore new locations.

**Data**
* Songs by artists near geographic location (Echonest)
* Music player (Spotify)
* MongoDB database of U.S. cities (derived from [U.S. Cities Data](http://simplemaps.com/resources/us-cities-data))

**Algorithms or Special Techniques**
Serve random latitudes and longitudes from the database. Derive city and state from Google reverse coder.

**APIs**
* EchoNest API
* Spotify Play Button
* Google Reverse Geocoding API
* Google Charts API
